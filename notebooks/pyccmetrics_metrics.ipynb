    "## 🧮 Code Complexity Metrics Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This section describes the **code complexity metrics** that can be calculated using the package.  \n",
    "These metrics help analyze **readability, maintainability, and design quality** of source code at different levels — *method*, *class*, and *file*.\n",

    "### 🧩 Method-Level Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Metric** | **Meaning** | **Variants** | **Interpretation** |\n",
    "|-------------|-------------|---------------|--------------------|\n",
    "| **FOUT (Fan-Out)** | Counts how many *other methods* are called by a given method. It measures coupling — how dependent a method is on others. | `avg`, `max`, `total` | High values → method depends heavily on others → tightly coupled, harder to maintain. |\n",
    "| **MLOC (Method Lines of Code)** | Counts the number of lines inside a method. | `avg`, `max`, `total` | Longer methods tend to be harder to test, understand, or reuse. |\n",
    "| **NBD (Nested Block Depth)** | Measures how deeply control structures are nested (e.g., `if`, `for`, `while`). | `avg`, `max`, `total` | Deep nesting → lower readability and higher cognitive load. |\n",
    "| **PAR (Parameters)** | Number of parameters a method accepts. | `avg`, `max`, `total` | Too many parameters → method may be doing too much or needs refactoring. |\n",
    "| **VG (McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity)** | Measures the number of linearly independent paths through a method’s control flow. | `avg`, `max`, `total` | Higher VG → more branches (`if`/`else`/loops) → higher testing effort and bug risk. A VG > 10 is typically considered complex. |\n",

    "\n",
    "| **Metric** | **Meaning** | **Variants** | **Interpretation** |\n",
    "|-------------|-------------|---------------|--------------------|\n",
    "| **NOF (Number of Fields)** | Total number of member variables (attributes) in a class. | `avg`, `max`, `total` | Too many fields may indicate the class has too many responsibilities. |\n",
    "| **NOM (Number of Methods)** | Counts how many methods are defined in the class. | `avg`, `max`, `total` | High NOM suggests large, possibly “god” classes that might need decomposition. |\n",
    "| **NSF (Number of Static Fields)** | Number of `static` (class-level) fields. | `avg`, `max`, `total` | Many static fields can lead to tight coupling and global state issues. |\n",
    "| **NSM (Number of Static Methods)** | Number of `static` methods defined in a class. | `avg`, `max`, `total` | High static usage may reduce flexibility (less polymorphism). |\n",

    "\n",
    "| **Metric** | **Meaning** | **Variants** | **Interpretation** |\n",
    "|-------------|-------------|---------------|--------------------|\n",
    "| **ACD (Anonymous Class Declarations)** | Number of anonymous (inline) classes declared in the file. | `value` | Too many anonymous classes may reduce readability. |\n",
    "| **NOI (Number of Interfaces)** | Number of interfaces defined in the file. | `value` | Indicates abstraction; too many might mean overengineering. |\n",
    "| **NOT (Number of Classes)** | Number of top-level and inner classes in the file. | `value` | High NOT → file may be too large or contain unrelated classes. |\n",
    "| **TLOC (Total Lines of Code)** | Total number of lines (including methods, classes, etc.) in the file. | `value` | Large TLOC → potentially harder to maintain or navigate. |\n",

    "|------------|----------------------|----------------|\n",
    "| **Methods** | Local complexity (control flow, dependencies) | Improve readability and reduce testing effort. |\n",
    "| **Classes** | Object design complexity (fields, methods, structure) | Ensure proper encapsulation and cohesion. |\n",
    "| **Files** | Module organization and size | Maintain modularity and readability. |\n",
